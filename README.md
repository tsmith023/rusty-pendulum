# rusty-pendulum

This is a simple pendulum simulation written in Rust making use of the Runga-Kutta 4th order method
to solve the first-order differential equation efficiently.

Currently, only the Double Pendulum is implemented. However, the Single Pendulum and Coupled Pendulum are planned to be implemented in the future.
