# rusty-pendulum

This is a simple pendulum simulation written in Rust making use of the Runga-Kutta 4th order method
to solve the first-order differential equation efficiently.

Currently, only the Double Pendulum is implemented.

However, the Single Pendulum and Coupled Pendulum is planned to be implemented in the future.

In addition, the binary is yet to be fully packaged into a WASM module.
